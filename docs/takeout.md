# Takeout Free

Takeout Free is a production-ready starter for building real-time, cross-platform
applications. It's the open-source version of Takeout with simplified deployment
via Uncloud (self-hosted Docker).

Find out much more by using `bun tko` for available commands and
`bun tko docs list` for built-in docs.

## Repository Structure

The entire project lives in a single package.json to avoid monorepo complexity.
Everything from the web app to native iOS and Android builds is defined in this
codebase.

## Build Pipeline

The CI/CD setup runs on GitHub Actions. The pipeline handles running Playwright
integration tests, building the web app, running the full test suite with Vitest
and Playwright, and managing database migrations.

## Uncloud Deployment

This starter uses Uncloud for self-hosted deployment to any VPS with Docker.
See [deployment-uncloud.md](./deployment-uncloud.md) for setup instructions.

## Services Integration

Environment management is code-driven, with validation and automatic generation
of the env files. Docker Compose orchestrates local development and test
environments.

## Development Scripts

Beyond the standard npm scripts, there are utilities for running the development
environment, connecting to the production database via psql, and various
developer productivity tools.

## Libraries

Authentication is handled by better-auth with better-fetch for network requests.
Forms use @tanstack/react-form. Validation runs through Valibot rather than Zod
for better performance and smaller bundles.

## Developer Utilities

@take-out/helpers and the ./src/ folder has a lot of nice helpers. There's an
event emitter system for cross-component communication, keyboard shortcut
management that works across platforms, URL unfurling for rich link previews,
image upload with progress and error handling, and drag and drop that works in
the browser with support for nested drop areas.

## Zero Integration

Zero provides the real-time sync foundation. We've built the `over-zero` package
which adds tons of nice helpers on top, and gotten a nice setup for Zero that
makes managing it, debugging it and deploying it easier.

## Development Experience

The project uses Bun for speed. TypeScript runs through tsgo for faster
compilation. Circular dependency detection uses @glideapps/ts-helper. There's
automatic node version checking to catch environment issues early.

Database operations include sync, pull, and push commands that work with both
local and production. Environment variables can be pulled from production for
debugging.

Components like EnsureStableId prevent React key issues. useStableMemo avoids
unnecessary rerenders. The Dev namespace and devGlobal make debugging easier by
exposing internals in development.

Helper functions and hooks cover common patterns like useAsyncEffect for async
operations in effects, sleep for delays without callback hell, useLazyMount for
deferring expensive renders, and idle detection for running background work.

## UI Framework

Tamagui provides the component foundation with Reanimated as the motion driver
for smooth animations across web and native.

There are composable component primitives like ListItem and Button that work as
building blocks for more complex UI.

## Native Dependencies

The project includes several native dependencies that enhance mobile
capabilities:

**UI & Gestures**

- react-native-reanimated for performant animations across platforms
- react-native-gesture-handler for comprehensive gesture support
- @gorhom/bottom-sheet for native bottom sheet modals
- react-native-keyboard-controller for advanced keyboard handling
- react-native-safe-area-context for safe area insets

**Media & Graphics**

- @tamagui/image-next for optimized image loading (wraps expo-image)
- expo-image-picker for camera and photo library access
- @nandorojo/galeria for image galleries
- react-native-svg for SVG rendering
- @tamagui/linear-gradient for gradient support

**Data & Storage**

- @op-engineering/op-sqlite for local SQLite database (used by Zero)

**System & Utilities**

- expo-haptics for haptic feedback
- expo-splash-screen for native splash screen
- expo-clipboard for clipboard access
- expo-crypto for cryptographic operations
- zeego for native context menus

**Effects**

- expo-blur for native blur effects
- expo-glass-effect for frosted glass UI effects

**UI Framework Components**

- @tamagui/toast for toast notifications

**Build Configuration**

The following packages are configured but may not be directly imported (used by
frameworks or at build time):

- expo-font for custom font loading
- expo-web-browser for OAuth browser flows
- react-native-screens for native navigation primitives
- react-native-bottom-tabs for native bottom tab navigation
- react-native-permissions for runtime permission handling (configured in
  app.config.ts)

All native dependencies are configured in app.config.ts with appropriate iOS and
Android permissions and build settings. The project uses static frameworks on
iOS for faster builds and better compatibility.
