# generated

this folder is auto-generated by on-zero. do not edit files here directly.

## what's generated

- `models.ts` - exports all models from ../models
- `types.ts` - typescript types derived from table schemas
- `tables.ts` - exports table schemas for type inference
- `groupedQueries.ts` - namespaced query re-exports for client setup
- `syncedQueries.ts` - namespaced syncedQuery wrappers for server setup

## usage guidelines

**do not import generated files outside of the data folder.**

### queries

write your queries as plain functions in `../queries/` and import them directly:

```ts
// ✅ good - import from queries
import { channelMessages } from '~/data/queries/message'
```

the generated query files are only used internally by zero client/server setup.

### types

you can import types from this folder, but prefer re-exporting from `../types.ts`:

```ts
// ❌ okay but not preferred
import type { Message } from '~/data/generated/types'

// ✅ better - re-export from types.ts
import type { Message } from '~/data/types'
```

## regeneration

files are regenerated when you run:

```bash
bun on-zero generate
```

or in watch mode:

```bash
bun on-zero generate --watch
```
